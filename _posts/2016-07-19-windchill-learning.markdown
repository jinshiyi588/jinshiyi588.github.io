- I recently work on the project of windchill. Windchill is a PLM(Product Lifecycle Management) software.
It helps the company manage complex, cross-functional processes, coordinating the efforts of distributed teams to consistently and efficiently develop the best possible products.
- I am responsible for developing the customizing features for our CDM(customer document management) system.
- Today I receive a very tough task about developing a new feature, to do the role authorization for different kind of documents. One documents has several roles and every role has different permission.
- I should find the documents under a folder, and list the roles of documents, and then let the administrator to do the user authorization.
